# Hi, I'm Joseph ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a CS major at UNC-Chapel Hill, and am passionate about learning and applying innovative frameworks and design patterns. Some technologies I've had practical experience with involve Angular + Node.js, Google Cloud, and PHP/MySQL.

## So far, I've worked on...

- Streamlining efficiency with a [productivity assistant](https://pankoapp.com) that learns as you use it ([ðŸ“‚](https://github.com/thejykim/pankoapp))
- Enabling musicians with a [powerful music creation kit](https://intellinote.io) ([ðŸ“‚](https://github.com/thejykim/intellinote))
- Applying a clustering algorithm to [classify crime hotspots](https://thejyk.com/projects/cdc2019) ([ðŸ“‚](https://github.com/thejykim/cdc2019))

Each project has relevant stacks listed in the project's README. Check them out!
