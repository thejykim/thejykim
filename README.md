# Hi, I'm Joseph ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a CS major at UNC-Chapel Hill, and am passionate about learning and applying innovative frameworks and design patterns. Some technologies I've had practical experience with involve Angular, ReactJS, Node.js, Google Cloud, and PHP/MySQL.

## So far, I've worked on...

- Streamlining efficiency with a [productivity assistant](https://kanban-37f41.web.app) that learns as you use it ([ðŸ“‚](https://github.com/thejykim/pankoapp))
- Enabling musicians with a [powerful music creation kit](https://intellinote.io) ([ðŸ“‚](https://github.com/thejykim/intellinote))
- Applying a clustering algorithm to [classify crime hotspots](https://thejyk.com/projects/cdc2019) ([ðŸ“‚](https://github.com/thejykim/cdc2019))
- A highly flexible and abstracted login system built to support different use cases ([ðŸ“‚](https://github.com/thejykim/nextlogin))

## I'm currently working on...

- Making college housing intuitive and stress-free with [Roomadillo](https://roomadillo.com)
- Bringing free lessons to IntelliNote, and expanding the social platform ([ðŸ“‚](https://github.com/thejykim/intellinote))
